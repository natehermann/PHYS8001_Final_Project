# PHYS8001_Final_Project

The main jupyter notebook is titled Hermann_Nathaniel_final_project.ipynb. This file uses data from the Sean Lahman database, titled Pitching.csv and Teams.csv respectively. This data is modified and saved in usable formats for my code in the files named one_previous_yr.csv, three_previous_yr.csv, and five+previous_yr.csv. The notebook contains all of the PCA/TSNE fitting, regression modelling, and neural network. I also include the written final report.
